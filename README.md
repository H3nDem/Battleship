# Battleship

## Description
Small project realized back in highschool of the Battleship board game.
It's a far more simpler version of it.
You only have 1 ship to find and hit in this 10x10 tiles within 5 tries in order to win.
To choose coordinates, you have to enter them manually in the terminal.
